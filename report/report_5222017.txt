Can we consider file name as feature?

No. We collected videos from different sources. Not all sources follow same file naming convention. While file names like
"bs-apr3-rigged-retirement-2016-05-09-23-13-51-030" includes the original file name, file names like 'PolAd_BernieSanders_q6i54' 
does not.
But file name can help us class classify "political non-campaign ads" e.g ads for the shows like CNN's election night coverage or Trevor Noah show.
As this ads will contain show name as part of file name most of the times.

Proving a hypothesis:||
----------------------
-------------
Hypothesis:|| 
-------------
In case of political ads video frames will contain text mostly at the begining or end of the video

-------------
Experiment:||
-------------

We splitted the video frames into quartiles and into 10 groups.

quartiles approach: 
If the video length is 31 seconds, video frames will be divided in 4 groups of 8,8,8,7 frames respectively.

10 group approach: 
If the video length is 31 seconds, video frames will be divided in 10 groups of 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4 frames respectively.

For quartile approach we observed the following observation:

Q1 i.e. first quarter of a collection of 846 political video contains only 66% of frames with text data.
Q2 i.e. second quarter of a collection of 846 political video contains only 71% of frames with text data.
Q3 i.e. third quarter of a collection of 846 political video contains only 72% of frames with text data.
Q4 i.e. fourth quarter of a collection of 846 political video contains 84% of frames with text data.


Therefore the hypothesis that we assumed from manually observing the dataset, is partially proven correct. As the 4th quarter contains more text
data than other 3 quarters. We can not prove if the frames at the begining of the videos contains more textual information with this method.

For 10 group approach we observed the following observation:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
bucket number        |       percentage of the frames containing text
---------------------------------------------------------------------
b1                   |       56%
b2                   |       73%
b3                   |       71%
b4                   |       71%
b5                   |       72%
b6                   |       72%
b7                   |       72%
b8                   |       70%
b9                   |       72%
b10                  |       88%
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Once again we can see the last 10% timeframes of all the political ad campaign videos has highest concentration of textual information.
The beginning 10% timeframes have actually least concentration of textual information.

We can explain the low concentration of textual information in the beginning 10% or 25%:
1. Videos sometimes contains one or two blank frames at the beginning, which contributes to the low concentration of textual information.
2. We need to identify some certain texts in these video frames instead of looking for every texts. Because certain words has higher importance in
determining if a video ad is a political campaign ad or not.
